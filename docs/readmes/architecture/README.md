# Architecture Overview

Welcome to the architecture documentation! üéâ This section is your go-to for understanding how all the moving parts of our project come together. Whether you‚Äôre interested in the frontend, backend, database, or API, we‚Äôve got you covered with deep dives and justifications for the technical decisions we‚Äôve made. Let‚Äôs break it all down in a simple, no-nonsense way.

## Structure

Our architecture is broken into key areas, each with its own set of responsibilities. This modular design allows for scalability, flexibility, and maintainability‚Äîbasically, future-proofing the whole thing! üí™

Here‚Äôs the high-level breakdown:

- **Frontend**: Where all the user-facing magic happens. Built with Vue.js to ensure a reactive and smooth experience.
- **Backend**: The brain behind the operations, handling all the business logic and managing the API interactions. We‚Äôve gone with Node.js/Express for performance and scalability.
- **Database**: We‚Äôre using PostgreSQL, a powerful relational database that ensures data integrity and efficiency.
- **API**: This is the glue between the frontend and backend. Our REST API serves data in a consistent way for seamless frontend consumption.

Now, let's dive into each of these areas in more detail!

---

## Frontend

The frontend is built using **Vue.js**, which provides a reactive and component-based architecture. This makes the UI snappy and easy to maintain.

- **Main Responsibilities**:
  - Rendering the user interface
  - Handling user interactions
  - Communicating with the backend through the API

For a deeper dive into how the frontend is architected, check out the [Frontend Architecture](./frontend/README.md) guide. You'll also find info on the trade-offs we made and answers to some pre-emptive questions.

## Backend

The backend is powered by **Node.js** and **NestJS**, which allows for handling high loads and serving data quickly. It's designed to be lean and fast while doing the heavy lifting in terms of business logic and data processing.

- **Main Responsibilities**:
  - API logic and endpoint management
  - Data processing and manipulation
  - Communication with the database

Want more details? Head over to the [Backend Architecture](./backend/README.md) for a full breakdown. We also dive into the trade-offs we made during development and preemptively answer any burning questions you might have!

## Database

We‚Äôre using **PostgreSQL**, which is a solid choice for a relational database. It handles all the structured data we‚Äôre working with‚Äîlike videos, tags, and user info. This ensures consistency and reliability across the board.

- **Main Responsibilities**:
  - Storing and organizing data
  - Ensuring data integrity and relationships
  - Handling queries efficiently

To explore the schema design and relationships, check out the [Database Architecture](./database/README.md) documentation. We‚Äôve also outlined the trade-offs we made during the design process and answered pre-emptive questions you might have.

---

## API

Our API is RESTful and built with **NestJS**, designed to be consistent and scalable. It acts as the intermediary between the frontend and the backend, ensuring that data flows smoothly between both.

- **Main Responsibilities**:
  - Exposing endpoints for frontend communication
  - Handling data validation and security
  - Serving resources efficiently

Dive into the [API Design](./api/README.md) for a full overview of the endpoints, along with the design choices we made. We‚Äôve also covered trade-offs and pre-emptive questions here.

## Trade-offs and Justifications

Throughout the architecture, we‚Äôve made certain trade-offs to balance flexibility, performance, and simplicity. Each section has its own trade-off documentation where we justify the choices we made. You can find these here:

- [Frontend Trade-offs](./frontend/tradeoffs.md)
- [Backend Trade-offs](./backend/tradeoffs.md)
- [Database Trade-offs](./database/tradeoffs.md)
- [API Trade-offs](./api/tradeoffs.md)

## Pre-emptive Questions

We know you might have questions like ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you choose X framework?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow scalable is this architecture?‚Äù. We've preemptively answered a lot of those in each section's **Pre-emptive Questions** guide:

- [Frontend Pre-emptive Questions](./frontend/preemptive-questions.md)
- [Backend Pre-emptive Questions](./backend/preemptive-questions.md)
- [Database Pre-emptive Questions](./database/preemptive-questions.md)
- [API Pre-emptive Questions](./api/preemptive-questions.md)
