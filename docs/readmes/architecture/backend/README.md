# Backend Architecture Overview

Welcome to the backend of our project! üåê This backend is built with **NestJS**, a Node.js framework that makes developing scalable and maintainable applications a breeze. Our primary focus here is syncing and managing video data from Wistia, handling tags, and exposing a public API for the frontend to consume. Let‚Äôs break it all down so you can get a feel for how things work under the hood.

---

## Framework: NestJS + TypeScript

We chose **NestJS** for its modular architecture, which helps keep the code organized and scalable. Combined with **TypeScript**, we ensure type safety and reduce the risk of bugs.

- **NestJS**: Offers an intuitive, modular system for building scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing, which means fewer runtime errors and more reliable code.

For a deeper dive into our decision-making process, check out our [Backend Trade-offs](./tradeoffs.md) document.

## Project Structure

Here‚Äôs an overview of the key directories and their purposes:

- **`src/`**: The heart of the backend codebase.
  - **`app.module.ts`**: The root module that brings all services, controllers, and modules together.
  - **`videos/`**: Handles all logic related to videos, including syncing with Wistia, managing video data, and exposing API endpoints.
  - **`tags/`**: Manages tags, including CRUD operations and their relationship with videos.
  - **`sync/`**: Contains the logic for syncing video data from Wistia with our database.
  - **`dtos/`**: Data Transfer Objects for request validation and structuring API responses.
  - **`redis/`**: Redis configuration and caching logic to optimize performance.
  - **`migrations/`**: Database migration files for schema changes.

This structure keeps everything modular and easy to maintain.

## Key Modules

### **Videos Module**

The **`videos/`** module is the core of the app, handling all video-related logic. It interacts with both the database and the Wistia API to sync, manage, and expose video data.

- **Video Entity**: Defines the structure of video data (e.g., ID, title, visibility, tags, plays).
- **VideosService**: Handles business logic for fetching, updating, and syncing videos.
- **VideosController**: Exposes REST API endpoints for fetching videos and managing visibility.
- **Wistia Sync**: Periodically syncs videos with the Wistia API to keep local data up to date.

Check out the [Video Sync](../features/video-sync.md) document for a deeper dive into the syncing logic.

### **Tags Module**

The **`tags/`** module handles video tagging functionality, allowing users to categorize videos with relevant tags.

- **Tag Entity**: Defines the structure of a tag (e.g., ID, name, associated videos).
- **TagsService**: Contains logic for creating, fetching, and updating tags.
- **TagsController**: Exposes API endpoints for managing tags.

For more on how we handle tags, visit the [Tag Management](../features/tag-management.md) document.

### **Sync Module**

The **`sync/`** module ensures that the data in our local database is kept in sync with external sources, like Wistia.

- **SyncService**: This service is responsible for fetching data from the Wistia API and updating the local database. It also handles updating tags and video metadata (e.g., plays, visibility).
- **Redis Cache**: After syncing, the Redis cache is invalidated to ensure that fresh data is always available.

### **Redis Module**

Caching is handled through **Redis**, which helps us store video playlists and avoid redundant database queries.

- **Caching Playlists**: Playlists are cached for performance, and the cache is invalidated when videos or their visibility are updated.
- **Redis Integration**: The `RedisModule` configures the Redis client and provides it to services that require caching functionality.

## Database and Migrations

We use **TypeORM** as our Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to interact with the database. **Migrations** are used to manage schema changes over time, ensuring that we can update the database structure as the project evolves.

- **Migrations**: Our migration files modify the schema, such as creating the `videos` and `tags` tables. These migrations are run during deployment to ensure the database is up-to-date.

To learn more about our database structure, check out the [Database Schema](../database/README.md).

---

## API Layer

We expose a RESTful API that allows the frontend to interact with videos, tags, and other resources. Key endpoints include:

- **GET /videos**: Fetches a list of videos, possibly filtered by visibility.
- **PATCH /videos/sync**: Triggers the video sync with Wistia.
- **PATCH /videos/:id/visibility**: Toggles the visibility of a specific video.

The **ApiClientService** interacts with the Wistia API, making calls to fetch video data, update video stats, and handle errors gracefully.

For a full list of API endpoints, see our [API Documentation](../api/README.md).

---

## Testing Strategy

We use **Jest** for unit testing, ensuring that our services and controllers function as expected. Our tests cover:

- **Video Sync Logic**: Ensuring videos are correctly synced with Wistia.
- **Redis Cache**: Testing that caching and invalidation work as expected.
- **REST API**: Verifying that the API responds correctly to requests.

## Wrapping Up

This backend is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, with a focus on syncing videos from Wistia, managing video tags, and providing a clean API for the frontend. By using NestJS, TypeScript, and Redis, we‚Äôve built a robust foundation that can handle future growth and complexity.
