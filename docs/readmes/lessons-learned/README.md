# Lessons Learned 🎓

So, we’ve been through the ups, the downs, and the inevitable “why is this happening now?!” moments. Building this project was a journey—sometimes smooth, sometimes bumpy, but always packed with valuable lessons. Let’s dive into what we learned along the way, both on the frontend and backend. Spoiler alert: I learned a LOT.

## 1. Syncing with an External API is Hard 💥

Let’s start with the big one: **syncing with external APIs is no joke**. It sounds simple on paper, right? “Just hit the API, grab the data, store it, done!” But nope. There’s a lot more to it:

- **Rate limits**: APIs don’t like being bombarded with requests, and if you don’t handle this right, you’re in for some trouble.
- **Inconsistent Data**: External APIs can change or have unexpected behavior, which means you need to handle these surprises gracefully.
- **Data Sync Issues**: Making sure the database and API are in sync is like trying to keep two toddlers in line—there’s a lot of unpredictability.

Lesson learned: **Always expect things to break, handle them, and plan for it**. Error handling (we’ll get to that) is key here.

## 2. Error Handling is More Important Than You Think ⚠️

Look, nobody likes thinking about error handling when they’re writing code—it’s not glamorous, but it’s absolutely necessary.

- **Frontend Errors**: When something breaks in the UI, it needs to fail gracefully. Users don’t need to know that an API call failed; they just need to know what they can do next. Error boundaries in Vue to the rescue!
- **Backend Failures**: If the backend crashes, it’s not just an oops moment, it’s a “the whole app is down” situation. Global error handlers? Yes, please!

Lesson learned: **Make your error messages helpful but non-scary. Users don’t need to know your code cried itself to sleep—just that it didn’t work, and here’s what to do.**

## 3. Knowing When "Good Enough" is Good Enough 💡

Oh man, this one hit hard. When you’re building something, especially on your own, there’s always a temptation to keep tweaking, perfecting, polishing...forever. But the thing is, sometimes **good enough is exactly that: good enough**.

- **Frontend Perf**: Yes, you could spend days optimizing the load times, but for now, as long as it’s fast enough for the users, let’s ship it.
- **Backend Optimization**: Sure, we could dive deep into query optimizations right now, but is the app crashing or is it okay? If it’s the latter, we can always optimize later.

Lesson learned: **Perfection is overrated; progress isn’t. Don’t get stuck in the “tweak zone” when you can be shipping features.**

## 4. Doing This by Yourself is Hard 😅

Solo devs out there, I see you. This was a grind. Coordinating between **frontend** and **backend** while also managing API integrations, debugging, and figuring out CI/CD pipelines all on your own? Not easy.

- There’s no one to bounce ideas off of when you’re stuck (except maybe your rubber ducky).
- Time management? Yeah, that’s tricky when you’re wearing all the hats.

Lesson learned: **A team makes this process not just faster, but more fun. Next time, I’ll definitely bring in more hands on deck.**

## 5. I Didn’t Think I Could Do Window Manipulation in Vue, but I Did! 🚀

Vue is powerful. There were times where I doubted myself—"Can I really manipulate the window object in Vue?" The answer is yes, yes I can. From handling **window resizing events** to triggering full-screen mode, Vue handled it like a champ.

- **Frontend Magic**: Adding window event listeners for dynamic UI changes, like responsive resizing or detecting viewport changes, was easier than expected.
- **Learning Moments**: Sometimes, the framework doesn’t stop you from doing cool stuff—you just have to explore and experiment!

Lesson learned: **Vue can do more than you think. Don’t be afraid to push the boundaries of the framework—you might surprise yourself!**

## Wrapping Up

So, that’s the tea on what I learned while building this thing. From API headaches to realizing “good enough” can be a game-changer, we came out stronger on the other side. Every project is a learning experience, and this one definitely pushed me in all the right ways.
