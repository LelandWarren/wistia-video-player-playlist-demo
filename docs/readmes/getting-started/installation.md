# Installation Guide

Hey! Excited to get started? Letâ€™s walk through the process step-by-step to get everything up and running. Don't worryâ€”this guide is comprehensive but simple, and I'll make sure you know exactly what to do. If you hit any bumps along the way, our [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting.md) has your back! ðŸŽ‰

## 1. Clone the Repo

First things first, let's clone the repository to your local machine. Make sure youâ€™ve got Git installed (if not, check out the [prerequisites guide](./prerequisites.md)).

```
git clone http://wistia-chsdjj@git.codesubmit.io/wistia/full-stack-create-fork-fvuxww
```

Once thatâ€™s done, youâ€™ll have all the project files on your local machine. Ready? Letâ€™s move on!

## 2. Spin up the Database

Weâ€™re using Docker to keep things clean and isolated. Head over to the backend directory, then run the database using Docker Compose.

```

# Do this in a separate terminal

cd backend
docker-compose up
```

This will set up your PostgreSQL database in a container. Wait until Docker is done starting up everythingâ€”itâ€™ll let you know when it's ready!

## 3. Run the DB Migrations

Now that the database is running, let's make sure it's structured properly. Migrations are basically scripts that set up your database tables and columns.

```
cd backend
npm run migration:run
```

Thatâ€™s it! Your database is now ready to store data.

## 4. Set Up Your Environment Variables

This app requires some environment variables to run smoothly. Specifically, youâ€™ll need to set up your `WISTIA_API_TOKEN` (and other variables if needed). Letâ€™s get that `.env` file set up:

```
cd backend
echo "WISTIA_API_TOKEN=xxxx" > .env

# verify contents

cat .env
```

Replace `xxxx` with your actual Wistia API token.

## 5. Start the Backend Service

Time to get the backend up and running! Install the necessary dependencies and then start the service:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

The backend should now be up and listening on `http://localhost:3000`. ðŸŽ‰

## 6. Sync Data into the Database

With the backend running, we need to pull in some initial video data from Wistia into your database. Run the following curl command:

```
curl --location --request PATCH 'http://localhost:3000/videos/sync'
```

This will sync all the data you need from Wistia and load it into your PostgreSQL database. ðŸ”„

## 7. Run the Frontend Vue App

Last but definitely not least, letâ€™s get the frontend up and running. Navigate to the frontend directory, install dependencies, and fire up the Vue app:

```
cd ..
cd frontend
npm install
npm run serve
```

The frontend will now be running locally at `http://localhost:8080`. Open that in your browser, and boomâ€”youâ€™re live! ðŸš€

If youâ€™ve followed along this far, congrats! Youâ€™ve got the app running both backend and frontend. If anything went sideways, no worriesâ€”head over to the [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting.md) for solutions to common issues.
